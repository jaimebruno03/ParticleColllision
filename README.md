# Simulating Particle Collisions with C++ and ROOT

This project simulates elementary particle collisions using C++ and ROOT. The main goal is to generate and analyze collision events through Monte Carlo methods, focusing on extracting the resonance signal of the Kâˆ— particle. ROOT framework need to be installed

- Simulates 105 collision events, generating around 120 particles per event.
- Includes different particle types: Ï€+, Ï€âˆ’, K+, Kâˆ’, P+, Pâˆ’, Kâˆ—.
- Implements three main C++ classes:

    ParticleType â†’ Defines stable particles (name, mass, charge).

    ResonanceType â†’ Extends ParticleType for unstable resonances, adding width.

    Particle â†’ Describes individual particles, including momentum components.

- Uses ROOT histograms for data visualization and statistical analysis.

# Code Structure

ðŸ“Œ ParticleType.h / .cxx â†’ Defines stable particles.

ðŸ“Œ ResonanceType.h / .cxx â†’ Defines unstable resonances.

ðŸ“Œ Particle.h / .cxx â†’ Handles particle properties and decays.

ðŸ“Œ main.cxx â†’ Executes Monte Carlo event generation and fills histograms.

ðŸ“Œ analysis.cxx â†’ Performs statistical analysis and visualization of results.

Angular and momentum distributions.

Invariant mass distributions for Ï€K pairs, identifying the Kâˆ— resonance.

Statistical fits are applied to validate results.
