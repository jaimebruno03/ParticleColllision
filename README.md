📡 Simulating Particle Collisions with C++ and ROOT

📖 Description

This project simulates elementary particle collisions using C++ and ROOT. The main goal is to generate and analyze collision events through Monte Carlo methods, focusing on extracting the resonance signal of the K∗ particle.

🚀 Features

✅ Simulates 105 collision events, generating around 120 particles per event.
✅ Includes different particle types: π+, π−, K+, K−, P+, P−, K∗.
✅ Uses TRandom functions from ROOT for random number generation.
✅ Implements three main C++ classes:

🧩 ParticleType → Defines stable particles (name, mass, charge).

⚛️ ResonanceType → Extends ParticleType for unstable resonances, adding width.

🎯 Particle → Describes individual particles, including momentum components.
✅ Generates and analyzes kinematic distributions (momentum, angles, invariant mass).
✅ Uses ROOT histograms for data visualization and statistical analysis.

🏗️ Code Structure

📌 ParticleType.h / .cxx → Defines stable particles.
📌 ResonanceType.h / .cxx → Defines unstable resonances.
📌 Particle.h / .cxx → Handles particle properties and decays.
📌 main.cxx → Executes Monte Carlo event generation and fills histograms.
📌 analysis.cxx → Performs statistical analysis and visualization of results.

🛠️ Installation & Compilation

🔹 Prerequisites

ROOT framework installed (installation guide).

C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

🏗️ Compilation

# Compile the simulation code
g++ main.cxx Particle.cxx ParticleType.cxx ResonanceType.cxx -o simulation `root-config --cflags --glibs`

# Compile the analysis script
g++ analysis.cxx -o analysis `root-config --cflags --glibs`

▶️ Running the Simulation

# Run the Monte Carlo simulation
./simulation

# Run the analysis on generated data
./analysis

📊 Results

📌 The program generates ROOT histograms showing:
✅ Particle type distributions.
✅ Angular and momentum distributions.
✅ Invariant mass distributions for πK pairs, identifying the K∗ resonance.
📌 Statistical fits are applied to validate results.
